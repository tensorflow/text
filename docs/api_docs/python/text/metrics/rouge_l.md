Computes LCS-based similarity score between the hypotheses and references.

```python
text.metrics.rouge_l(
    hypotheses, references, alpha=None
)
```

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

The Rouge-L metric is a score from 0 to 1 indicating how similar two sequences
are, based on the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS). In particular,
Rouge-L is the weighted harmonic mean (or f-measure) combining the LCS precision
(the percentage of the hypothesis sequence covered by the LCS) and the LCS
recall (the percentage of the reference sequence covered by the LCS).

This method returns the F-measure, Precision, and Recall for each (hypothesis,
reference) pair.

Alpha is used as a weight for the harmonic mean of precision and recall. A value
of 0 means recall is more important and 1 means precision is more important.
Leaving alpha unset implies alpha=.5, which is the default in the official
ROUGE-1.5.5.pl script. Setting alpha to a negative number triggers a
compatibility mode with the tensor2tensor implementation of ROUGE-L.

#### Args:

*   <b>`hypotheses`</b>: A RaggedTensor with shape [N, (hyp_sentence_len)] and
    integer or string values.
*   <b>`references`</b>: A RaggedTensor with shape [N, (ref_sentence_len)] and
    integer or string values.
*   <b>`alpha`</b>: optional float parameter for weighting

#### Returns:

an (f_measure, p_measure, r_measure) tuple, where each element is a vector of
floats with shape [N]. The i-th float in each vector contains the similarity
measure of hypotheses[i] and references[i].
