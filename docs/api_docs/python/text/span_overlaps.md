Returns a boolean tensor indicating which source and target spans overlap.

```python
text.span_overlaps(
    source_start, source_limit, target_start, target_limit, contains=False,
    contained_by=False, partial_overlap=False, name=None
)
```

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

The source and target spans are specified using B+1 dimensional tensors,
with `B>=0` batch dimensions followed by a final dimension that lists the
span offsets for each span in the batch:

* The `i`th source span in batch `b1...bB` starts at
  `source_start[b1...bB, i]` (inclusive), and extends to just before
  `source_limit[b1...bB, i]` (exclusive).
* The `j`th target span in batch `b1...bB` starts at
  `target_start[b1...bB, j]` (inclusive), and extends to just before
  `target_limit[b1...bB, j]` (exclusive).

`result[b1...bB, i, j]` is true if the `i`th source span overlaps with the
`j`th target span in batch `b1...bB`, where a source span overlaps a target
span if any of the following are true:

  * The spans are identical.
  * `contains` is true, and the source span contains the target span.
  * `contained_by` is true, and the source span is contained by the target
    span.
  * `partial_overlap` is true, and there is a non-zero overlap between the
    source span and the target span.

#### Args:

*   <b>`source_start`</b>: A B+1 dimensional potentially ragged tensor with
    shape `[D1...DB, source_size]`: the start offset of each source span.
*   <b>`source_limit`</b>: A B+1 dimensional potentially ragged tensor with
    shape `[D1...DB, source_size]`: the limit offset of each source span.
*   <b>`target_start`</b>: A B+1 dimensional potentially ragged tensor with
    shape `[D1...DB, target_size]`: the start offset of each target span.
*   <b>`target_limit`</b>: A B+1 dimensional potentially ragged tensor with
    shape `[D1...DB, target_size]`: the limit offset of each target span.
*   <b>`contains`</b>: If true, then a source span is considered to overlap a
    target span when the source span contains the target span.
*   <b>`contained_by`</b>: If true, then a source span is considered to overlap
    a target span when the source span is contained by the target span.
*   <b>`partial_overlap`</b>: If true, then a source span is considered to
    overlap a target span when the source span partially overlaps the target
    span.
*   <b>`name`</b>: A name for the operation (optional).

#### Returns:

A B+2 dimensional potentially ragged boolean tensor with shape
`[D1...DB, source_size, target_size]`.

#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the span tensors are incompatible.

#### Example:
  Given the following source and target spans (with no batch dimensions):

  ```python
  #         0    5    10   15   20   25   30   35   40
  #         |====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|
  # Source: [-0-]     [-1-] [2] [-3-][-4-][-5-]
  # Target: [-0-][-1-]     [-2-] [3]   [-4-][-5-]
  #         |====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|
  >>> source_start = [0, 10, 16, 20, 25, 30]
  >>> source_limit = [5, 15, 19, 25, 30, 35]
  >>> target_start = [0,  5, 15, 21, 27, 31]
  >>> target_limit = [5, 10, 20, 24, 32, 37]
  ```

  `result[i, j]` will be true at the following locations:

    * `[0, 0]` (always)
    * `[2, 2]` (if contained_by=True or partial_overlaps=True)
    * `[3, 3]` (if contains=True or partial_overlaps=True)
    * `[4, 4]` (if partial_overlaps=True)
    * `[5, 5]` (if partial_overlaps=True)
