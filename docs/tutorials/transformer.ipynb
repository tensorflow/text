        "## Why Transformers are significant\n",
        "\n",
        "- Transformers excel at modeling sequential data, such as natural language.\n",
        "- Unlike the [recurrent neural networks (RNNs)](./text_generation.ipynb), Transformers are parallelizable. This makes them efficient on hardware like GPUs and TPUs. The main reasons is that Transformers replaced recurrence with attention, and computations can happen simultaneously. Layer outputs can be computed in parallel, instead of a series like an RNN.\n",
        "- Unlike [RNNs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn) (like [seq2seq, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)) or [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) (for example, [ByteNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099)), Transformers are able to capture distant or long-range contexts and dependencies in the data between distant positions in the input or output sequences. Thus, longer connections can be learned. Attention allows each location to have access to the entire input at each layer, while in RNNs and CNNs, the information needs to pass through many processing steps to move a long distance, which makes it harder to learn.\n",
        "- Transformers make no assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data. This is ideal for processing a set of objects (for example, [StarCraft units](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii)).\n",

        "* The Transformers and their significance in machine learning\n",

        "The downsides of this architecture are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- For a time-series, the output for a time-step is calculated from the *entire history* instead of only the inputs and current hidden-state. This _may_ be less efficient.\n",
        "- If the input has a temporal/spatial relationship, like text or images, some positional encoding must be added or the model will effectively see a bag of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to practice, there are many things you could try with it. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use a different dataset to train the Transformer.\n",
        "* Create the \"Base Transformer\" or \"Transformer XL\" configurations from the original paper by changing the hyperparameters.\n",
        "* Use the layers defined here to create an implementation of [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)t beam search to get better predictions.\n",
