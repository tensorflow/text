        "\n",
        "- Transformers excel at modeling sequential data, such as natural language.\n",
        "- Unlike the [recurrent neural networks (RNNs)](./text_generation.ipynb), such as [LSTMs](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.676.4320\u0026rep=rep1\u0026type=pdf){:.external}, Transformers can be more computationally efficient and parallelizable across several specialized hardware, like GPUs and TPUs. One of the main reasons is that Transformers replaced recurrence with attention, and computations can happen simultaneously. Layer outputs can be calculated in parallel, instead of a series like an RNN.\n",
        "- Unlike [RNNs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn) (like [seq2seq, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215){:.external}) or [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) (for example, [ByteNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099){:.external}), Transformers are able to capture distant or long-range contexts and dependencies in the data between distant positions in the input or output sequences. Thus, longer connections can be learned. Attention allows each location to have access to the entire input at each layer, while in RNNs and CNNs, the information needs to pass through many processing steps to move a long distance, which makes it harder to learn.\n",
        "- Transformers make no assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data. This is ideal for processing a set of objects (for example, [StarCraft units](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii/#block-8){:.external}).\n",
