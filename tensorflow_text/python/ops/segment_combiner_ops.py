def combine_segments(segments, start_of_sequence_id, end_of_segment_id):
  """Combine one or more input segments for a model's input sequence.

  `combine_segments` combines the tokens of one or more input segments to a
  single sequence of token values and generates matching segment ids.
  `combine_segments` can follow a `Trimmer`, who limit segment lengths and
  emit `RaggedTensor` outputs, and can be followed up by `ModelInputPacker`.

  See `Detailed Experimental Setup` in `BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional
  Transformers for Language Understanding`
  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) for more examples of combined
  segments.


  `combine_segments` first flattens and combines a list of one or more
  segments
  (`RaggedTensor`s of n dimensions) together along the 1st axis, then packages
  any special tokens  into a final n dimensional `RaggedTensor`.

  And finally `combine_segments` generates another `RaggedTensor` (with the
  same rank as the final combined `RaggedTensor`) that contains a distinct int
  id for each segment.

  Example usage:

  ```
  segment_a = [[1, 2],
               [3, 4,],
               [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]

  segment_b = [[10, 20,],
               [30, 40, 50, 60,],
               [70, 80]]
  expected_combined, expected_ids = combine_segments([segment_a, segment_b])

  # segment_a and segment_b have been combined w/ special tokens describing
  # the beginning of a sequence and end of a sequence inserted.
  expected_combined=[
   [101, 1, 2, 102, 10, 20, 102],
   [101, 3, 4, 102, 30, 40, 50, 60, 102],
   [101, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 102, 70, 80, 102],
  ]

  # ids describing which items belong to which segment.
  expected_ids=[
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]]
  ```

  Args:
    segments: A list of `RaggedTensor`s with the tokens of the input segments.
      All elements must have the same dtype (int32 or int64), same rank, and
      same dimension 0 (namely batch size). Slice `segments[i][j, ...]`
      contains the tokens of the i-th input segment to the j-th example in the
      batch.
    start_of_sequence_id: a python int or scalar Tensor containing the id used
      to denote the start of a sequence (e.g. `[CLS]` token in BERT
      terminology).
    end_of_segment_id: a python int or scalar Tensor containing the id used to
      denote end of a segment (e.g. the `[SEP]` token in BERT terminology).

  Returns:
    a tuple of (combined_segments, segment_ids), where:

    combined_segments: A `RaggedTensor` with segments combined and special
      tokens inserted.
    segment_ids:  A `RaggedTensor` w/ the same shape as `combined_segments`
      and containing int ids for each item detailing the segment that they
      correspond to.
