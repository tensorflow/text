                  replacement_char=65533, name=None):
  """Decode UTF8 tokens into code points and return their bits.

  See the [RetVec paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09207) for details.

  Example:

  >>> code_points = utf8_binarize("hello", word_length=3, bits_per_char=4)
  >>> print(code_points.numpy())
  [0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1.]

  The codepoints are encoded bitwise in the little-endian order.
  The inner dimension of the output is always `word_length * bits_per_char`,
  because extra characters are truncated / missing characters are padded,
  and `bits_per_char` lowest bits of each codepoint is stored.

  Decoding errors (which in applications are often replaced with the character
  U+65533 "REPLACEMENT CHARACTER") are represented with `replacement_char`'s
  `bits_per_char` lowest bits.

  Args:
    tokens: A `Tensor` of tokens (strings) with any shape.
    word_length: Number of Unicode characters to process per word (the rest are
                 silently ignored; the output is zero-padded).
    bits_per_char: The number of lowest bits of the Unicode codepoint to encode.
    replacement_char: The Unicode codepoint to use on decoding errors.
    name: The op name (optional).

  Returns:
    A tensor of floating-point zero and one values corresponding to the bits
    of the token characters' Unicode code points.
    Shape: `[<shape of `tokens`>, word_length * bits_per_char]`.
