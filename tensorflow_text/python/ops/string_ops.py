  r"""Coerce UTF-8 input strings to structurally valid UTF-8.

  Any bytes which cause the input string to be invalid UTF-8 are substituted
  with the provided replacement character codepoint (default 65533). If you plan
  on overriding the default, use a single byte replacement character codepoint
  to preserve alignment to the source input string.

  In this example, the character \xDEB2 is an invalid UTF-8 bit sequence; the
  call to `coerce_to_structurally_valid_utf8` replaces it with \xef\xbf\xbd,
  which is the default replacement character encoding.
  >>> input_data = ["A", b"\xDEB2", "C"]
  >>> coerce_to_structurally_valid_utf8(input_data)
  <tf.Tensor: shape=(3,), dtype=string,
              numpy=array([b'A', b'\xef\xbf\xbdB2', b'C'], dtype=object)>

  Args:
    input: UTF-8 string tensor to coerce to valid UTF-8.
    replacement_char: The replacement character to be used in place of any
        invalid byte in the input. Any valid Unicode character may be used. The
        default value is the default Unicode replacement character which is
        0xFFFD (or U+65533). Note that passing a replacement character
        expressible in 1 byte, such as ' ' or '?', will preserve string
        alignment to the source since individual invalid bytes will be replaced
        with a 1-byte replacement. (optional)
    name: A name for the operation (optional).

  Returns:
    A tensor of type string with the same shape as the input.
